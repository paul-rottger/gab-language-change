[USER] FWIW, one of the actresses from "Teenage Catgirls in Heat" is a good friend of mine here in Austin. True story - and knowing her now, it's really hard to imagine her doing that, but it shows how Hollywood gets women to agree to nearly anything for "a break"...

RT RealRichardBail Khashoggi incident is enormously complex and worrisome in that it could seriously ignite geopolitical stresses. Maybe meant to destabilize Trump on eve of mid-terms. The ever hyper Saudis could use oil as payback. If they do it will be near apocalypse

[USER] [USER] You are absolutely correct. Just another area where sooooo many Americans are ignorant - the 1st Amendment protects us from GOV'T, not from companies, not from other people, not from corporations. Boggles my mind how dumbed down we've become re: the Constitution :(
 
It began here with Jewish Cultural Marxism (JCM) and the Frankfurt School intentionally recreating OUR societies [URL] They believed this would bring about more equality and world peace. A New World Order. But there is one problem with it. It doesn't work.

Good Morning! Monday, monday!
 
Vague memories of a fire dream. The setting was old, in that everything seemed out of place time wise. It was in a setting that I normally dream - intricate wooden buildings that have begun to sag and decay with age, but still holding sturdy (for now). It was a common theme, the need to get somewhere and get the job finished but multiple delays held us back. The town was flooded, but not so bad that people had evacuated or had water in their homes.
