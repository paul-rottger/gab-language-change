You're right. It's not about free speech to them, so don't accept that argument from them. They hate us and they hate America.

Oh thank you Jesus! I seriously prayed he would cancel UK trip. And nice snipe at Hussein too. London is currently full of the worst, snarling Trump haters. Pakistanis REALLY hate him since his comments on them. I write to POTUS so he knows there are English who are his staunch supporters .
 
You're right. It's not about free speech to them, so don't accept that argument from them. They hate us and they hate America.
 
Oh. Fuck.
 
Thanks! I hope you can share it with as many people as you know. I would like to see how far it can actually go.
